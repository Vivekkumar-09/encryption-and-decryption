National Computer Security Day is celebrated every year on 30 November. It is important to note that this year, the day will be observed on Thursday. We observe this day to draw the attention of people towards the importance of computer security. As the world is getting more advanced technologically, it is important to stay focused on computer security. Cyberattack threats are one of the major problems and we should find ways to tackle it to protect our personal information.
